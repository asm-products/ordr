// UI Patterns are representations of assembled UI elements.
// These patterns consist of design elements such as,
// typography, arrangement, color, border and spacing.
// These patterns can be repurposed again and again
// throughout the application/site.
// But the content and functionality of this pattern
// are subject to redefinition based on use.
// Modules and UI Patters can be directories unto themselves.
